# SCSS Design Overhaul Plan

## Global Styles (src/styles.scss)
- [ ] Update design tokens: Professional color palette, typography, spacing, shadows
- [ ] Enhance header/nav: Glassmorphism effect, better hover states, improved layout
- [ ] Modernize cards and layouts: Hover effects, better grid responsiveness, professional shadows/gradients
- [ ] Polish forms and buttons: Smoother inputs, better focus states, modern button styles with animations
- [ ] Improve animations: Subtle, professional transitions (fade-ins, hover scales)
- [ ] Ensure responsiveness: Refine media queries for seamless experience
- [ ] Add utilities: More helper classes for common patterns

## Component Styles
- [ ] src/app/components/login/login.component.scss: Professional login form styling
- [ ] src/app/components/home/home.component.scss: Enhanced home page layout and visuals
- [ ] src/app/components/news-list/news-list.component.scss: Modern news grid with hover effects
- [ ] src/app/components/news-detail/news-detail.component.scss: Polished article detail view
- [ ] src/app/components/register/register.component.scss: Professional registration form styling

## Followup Steps
- [ ] Test the app visually (run locally and check responsiveness)
- [ ] Verify accessibility and contrast
